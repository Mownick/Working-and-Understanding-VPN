A Virtual Private Network (VPN) offers several key advantages for online users. It helps mask the user's real IP address, which protects their identity and location from websites and trackers. VPNs also encrypt internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers, ISPs, or even public Wi-Fi administrators to see what the user is doing online. This is especially important when accessing the internet from unsecured networks like airports or cafes. Additionally, VPNs allow users to access websites and services that may be blocked or restricted in their region.

However, VPNs come with certain limitations. Free VPNs often have slower speeds, limited servers, or restrictions on data usage. Some websites can detect and block VPN traffic, preventing access even with a VPN. Also, while VPNs enhance privacy, users still need to trust that the VPN provider is handling their data responsibly, especially if it claims to follow a no-logs policy. Lastly, a VPN does not protect against viruses or phishing attacks ‚Äî it only secures your connection.
