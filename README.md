### üìå Notes:

* VPNs work by creating an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, preventing eavesdropping and surveillance.
* While using a VPN, your traffic is routed through a secure server in a different location, hiding your original IP address.
* They are especially useful when using open networks in caf√©s, airports, or public areas.
